# Classifying Twitter Tweets
 
All data used in this project is from Twitter through Codecademy 

There are two parts to this project. The first part uses a K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier to predict if a tweet will go viral or not. The second uses a Naive Bayes Classifier to predict what city a tweet was sent from

##Part 1:
The first part of this project can be found in the folder Viral_Tweets. The script for this project can be found under Viral_Tweet.py. In this project, I optimize the k value. The plot of the score for the first 200 k values can be found under Plot_of_k.png. The data for this part can be found in random_tweets.json.

##Part 2: 
The second part of this project can be found in the folder Tweet_Location. The script for this project can be found in Tweet_Location.py. The data for this project can be foudn in the three .json files
